# C-Teaching-Website
For our project in CS 320 we have created a website that can be used to learn C programming through interactive coding challenges. The website contains programming tutorials as well as the capability to write code and have it be compiled, run and tested by the server. Users can create an account and progress through the challenges in a sequential order where they may move on whenever they have written code that passes all the tests run on it.

# Instructions For Running Application
Navigate to C-Teaching-Website/app/programs/encryptor/ and open it in terminal. After opening in terminal, run `make` and compile the encryptor executable. After compiling the encryptor, open the C-Teaching-Website/app/ directory inside of terminal and run `node main.js` to start the local server. After starting the local server, visit localhost:8081 in a web browser on the same machine to access the website.

Website will be temporarily hosted on c-teaching.com, so the application can be accessed from there as well.
